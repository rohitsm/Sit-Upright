# Sit-Upright

Do you sit for long hours at a stretch? Tend to slouch a lot? [Tony Montana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Montana) (Al Pacino in ["Scarface"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_%281983_film%29)) reminds you every 30 minutes to sit upright.

**Aim:** Good habits are hard to inculcate. This extension helps you internalize and gradually inculcate the habit of maintaining a straight posture.
